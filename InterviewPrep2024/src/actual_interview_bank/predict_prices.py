"""
2nd round interview question from company A

You are given historical data of flight ticket prices.

Your task is to build a predictive model to estimate the prices of future flight tickets based on this data. The historical data includes the following features:

Distance of flight (in miles)
Number of stops (0 for non-stop, more for flights with stops)
Type of airline (encoded as integers; 1 for budget airlines, 2 for regular airlines, 3 for luxury airlines)
Day of the week (1 for Monday, 7 for Sunday)
You need to predict the Price of the ticket (in USD).

Input:
Your function will receive two inputs:

training_data: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents (distance, stops, airline_type, day_of_week, price).

test_data: A list of tuples, excluding the price (distance, stops, airline_type, day_of_week) for which you need to predict the ticket prices.

Output:
Your function should return a list of predicted prices for the test_data.

Example Answer:
array([378.81587407, 703.3430946 , â€¦])

For a flight of 1500 miles, 0 stops, regular airline, and on a Wednesday: $378.82
